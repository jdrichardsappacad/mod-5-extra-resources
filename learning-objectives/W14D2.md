## REACT COMPONENTS, JSX AND ROUTING

<br>
<hr>

## What is React?

- React is a JavaScript frontend library that builds webpages through a declarative, component based approach.
- Your entire React codebase is stored on your viewer's browser.

## What are React components?

- React components are functions that return JSX. Components can accept a props object as its only argument.

Syntax:

```js
    function ReactComponent(props){
        return (
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        )
    }
```

## What is JSX?

- JSX is a language made for react to enable declarative programming of ui. It is written like HTML and has similar tags.
- A compiler library called Babel compiles JSX into React functions that create HTML for your browser to display.
- Use braces within JSX to use JavaScript.

Syntax:

- `<h1>My Awesome H1</h1>`
- `<ReactComponent newKey={propValue}></ReactComponent>`
- `<div>{variableOrExpressionWithReturn}</div>`

## What are Component Props?

- React components are functions, and react calls these functions with one argument: a props object. We can define new key value pairs in this props object within JSX.  Props' keys are optionally deconstructed when the component is defined.

Syntax:

```js
function ReactComponent(propsObject){
    const { data } = propsObject
    return (
        <h1>{data}</h1>
    )
}
```

## What is React Router?

- A library that keeps react components in sync with the url. It manages window location and dynamic route matching, and more.
- **This curriculum uses React Router version 5**

Syntax:

```js
function App({ data }){
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path='/profile/:userId'>
                    <ProfileComponent data={data} />
                </Route>
            </Switch>
        </BrowserRouter>
    )
}
```

## What is the useParams hook from React Router and how does it allow you to use parameters in your route? What does it return?

- It enables you to extract wildcard values from your routes.
- `useParams()` returns an object with your route wildcard names as the key. We deconstruct the keys we need in our component.

Syntax:

- `const { userId } = useParams();`

## What tools do you have to redirect a user?

- Redirect component
- useHistory hook

Syntax:

```js
function ProfileComponent({ user }){
    if(!user) return <Redirect to='/login' />

    const history = useHistory();

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        history.push('/new/page');
        }
    }
```
