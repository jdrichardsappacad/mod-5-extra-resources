React Solo Week QUESTION PROTOCOL:

Questions will now be asked in your team Slack channel

How to Ask A Question During Solo Project Week:

After spending around 15 minutes debugging on your own:

Post the question in your team's Slack channel and press the PT Question button.
Your peers and instructional team will attempt to help you with the question via Slack first.
If unable to solve the issue via slack, a member of the Instructional team will come to your Breakout Room
Please remember wait times will be long during project week because of the nature of questions.

When posting on Slack please include:

1. The problem you’re facing: what you expect to happen vs what is actually happening.
3. Screenshots of relevant code and/or errors.
4. Important!! How you’ve tried to fix the problem

Reminders:

- Instructors will NOT come to the room based on PT.
- PT will only be used for administrative purposes.
- It is unacceptable to just post “Can someone come help me in my room”. You
  must, first, ask a question on Slack.
- Please do not DM the instructors for help.
- Instructors are not there to pair program or build your app, they are only
  there to guide you in the right direction

The Instructional Team is here to help you and wants you to succeed in every way.
We also want you to learn to become self-reliant programmers who can succeed IRL
using your resources (online, docs, Slack, cohort networking).
So this procedure is meant as a part of your growth as a professional programmer.

You Got This! Good Luck!
